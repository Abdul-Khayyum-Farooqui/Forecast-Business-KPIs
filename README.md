I used a video clip of an IPL match played between CSK and RCB teams. This dataset is downloaded from YouTube and is 2 minutes 35 seconds long. Further processing on this data will convert the video clip into frames. Using annotators, the data is converted into xml files which will be converted into CSV files on basis of our key performance.
